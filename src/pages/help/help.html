<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p wrap-text>This app is intended to help people practice foreign languages.</p>

<p wrap-text>One way of using it is to copy and paste some sentences from a conversation that you have had with your teacher or a friend, that you know are correct, that you know the meaning of and that you are interested in. </p>

<p wrap-text>The app then gives you a tool to ‘rerun’ this conversation, enabling you to become familiar with aspects of the language and practice them.</p>

<p wrap-text>We don’t think attempting to memorise sentences is particularly beneficial – its hard work and stultifying – but we do think that retention of the language comes naturally from focused attention and practice. </p>

<p wrap-text>Here is what we do with this app:</p>

<p wrap-text>We paste in a collection of sentences generated during a Skype video lesson and noted in a shared Google document.</p>

<p wrap-text>We give each collection of sentences a short name that will remind us what that lesson was about, and we note the date of the conversation.</p>

<p wrap-text>We limit the number of lines of text to about 12 but try to keep together all the sentences about  a particular topic – we think it helps retention if you can keep in view the whole conversation, or part of the conversation, whilst you are practicing.  If we have more than about 12 sentences then we simply create more than one text splitting up the conversation into logical parts.</p>

<p wrap-text>When we first practice a text then we read it though three times, as follows:</p>
<ul>


  <li>The first time, we read each sentence in order, make sure we understand it completely, and tap words that we
    think will help trigger our recall of that whole sentence at later stages. The words tapped turn red.</li>
  <li>There’s no hard an fast rule as to which words to turn red, but we tend to mark prominent nouns that we already
    know well, unimportant words that will help give a clue to the structure of the sentence, and the first word of the
    sentence is often useful. You will soon get used to what works for you.</li>
  <li>The words marked in red stay that way for your subsequent re-readings. But you can always change which words you
    have marked. At any stage, just tap them till they turn red or turn back to normal text.</li>
  <li>Once we’ve marked each sentence, we then use the light grey button at the bottom left of the screen to direct us
    in random order to each of the sentences and present that sentence, but with all the words not highlighted faded
    out. Reading a sentence with faded out words just heightens your attention to the language of that sentence – we
    find this really easy and relaxing to do, but surprisingly effective in kick-starting the process of
    familiarisation and retention.</li>
  <li>We then use the dark grey button at the bottom right of the screen to present us with each sentence but with all
    the words not highlighted blanked out. We then try to reproduce and say out loud (or at least under our breath if
    we are on bus or train) the whole sentence. We use any trick we can, to help – using the words highlighted in red
    to recall the meaning of the sentence, counting the number of boxes to try to generate the right number of words,
    using the punctuation to guess the structure, looking at preceding and succeeding sentences to remind ourselves of
    how the sentence came about in the whole conversation etc etc</li>
  <li>In addition, if we are a bit stuck, or if we want to confirm partial guesses tapping an individual grey box will
    reveal just that word. We don’t hesitate to use that feature – the purpose is not a test or memorisation challenge,
    it is simply familiarisation.</li>
  <li>Whenever we find a sentence a bit more difficult or we don’t recall the meaning that was originally intended then
    we use the buttons at the right hand side a few times to practise that sentence individually.</li>
</ul>
<p wrap-text>We find that its useful to practice a particular text once in the detailed way above and then on the
  following day, we usually find we can go straight to using the blanking out mode pretty successfully. </p>

<p wrap-text>The first time through the material from a lesson can take a bit of time, but with a text of about 12
  lines we find subsequent reviews take only 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p wrap-text>If we are having weekly lessons then we try to practice the material from our last couple of lessons three or four times each week, occasionally returning to older material to refresh it.  </p>

<p wrap-text>Following this routine we rarely need to review material from more than a few weeks ago and find that the new language of a few weeks ago rapidly becomes an established part of our repertoire.  Indeed, after a few weeks we delete older material from the app – it has served its purpose and our language capabilities have moved on.</p>

<h3>Advice</h3>

<ul><li>We don’t think this way of practicing is particularly useful for a random series of sentences – we think the mind
  gets familiar with things in context – isolated sentences don’t give this kind of context.</li>
<li>We don’t think this way of practicing is much use if you don’t fully understand the meaning of each of the
  sentences. </li>
<li>Part of what we are aiming for here is to help you move straight from meaning to language. That’s why we suggest
  you keep in view the whole context of the text when reviewing individual sentences. That’s also why there is no
  translation used in this app – if you already understand the meaning of each sentence why would you need translation?</li>
<li>For the same reasons we also don’t think that trying to use this tool to learn individual words, fragments or
  grammatical rules is of much value.</li>
<li>The process seems to work best for us when we have some connected phrases that have significance for us, and have
  linguistic challenges for us that we are aware of, and just need practice to make more familiar and more automatic.</li>
<li>Use the power of sleep – you will be surprised that if you simply read through your text along the lines we suggest
  and then come back to that same text the day after, whilst you have slept your mind will have incorporated and
  integrated much of what seemed unfamiliar yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The app identifies a sentence as anything followed by a new line character</li>
        <li>It identifies words as being anything followed by a space</li>
            <li>It identifies punctuation as being anything from the following list: .,\/#!?$%\^&\*;:{{'{'}}}=\-_`~()…¿¡<></li>
              <li>We’ve tried to be reasonably comprehensive, but we know this doesn’t work for every language.  Contact us if you have suggestions for improvement.</li>
                  <li>The app is designed as an ephemeral tool for things you are working on at the moment.  It is not designed for things you want to store long term.  Our intention is to make it so easy, convenient and efficient for you to practice the current material you are learning that it quickly becomes part of your own functioning in the new language so much so that you do not need an external store.</li>
                      <li>For that reason the app saves your own texts in the local storage facility of your browser.  This should work for nearly all browsers you are likely to come across.  Your data therefore never leaves the computer or tablet you are working on – it won’t be shared between other devices or other browsers, though it could be lost when for example your computer needs repair etc.   If you have material you might want to refer to long term then store that somewhere else.</li>
                          <li>The app is freely available on the www, we accept no liability for its use, and we would appreciate being credited whenever you refer to it or if you copy and develop our approach.</li>

<p wrap-text>The app was inspired by The Silent Way, the approach to learning foreign languages created by Caleb Gattegno in the 1970s.  Click <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Way">here</a> to find out more.</p>

    <p wrap-text>The app was designed by</p>
